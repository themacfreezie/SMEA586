      <abstract> The High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus HR) is an integrated set of geospatial data layers, including
				the best available National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), the 10-meter 3D Elevation Program Digital Elevation Model (3DEP DEM), and the
				National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The NHDPlus HR combines the NHD, 3DEP DEMs, and WBD to create a stream network with linear
				referencing, feature naming, "value added attributes" (VAAs), elevation-derived catchments, and other features for hydrologic data
				analysis. The stream network with linear referencing is a system of data relationships applied to hydrographic systems so that one
				stream reach "flows" into another and "events" can be tied to and traced along the network. The VAAs provide capabilities for upstream
				and downstream navigation with linear referencing, analysis, and modeling. The elevation derived catchments are used to associate
				other landscape attributes, such as land cover, with stream segments. </abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the watershed level. The data should be displayed and analyzed at
				scales appropriate for 1:24,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.

        <srccontr>The NHD serves as a comprehensive national flow network for use with surface water related geospatial information. The NHD
					uses "ReachCodes" and "Measure" fields to reference surface water events. A snapshot of the conterminous United States high
					resolution 1:24,000 or better NHD was used as the baseline framework from which enhancements to the network were built upon.
					Enhancements include feature names, network connectivity and network flow relationships. This enhanced NHD version was then used
					in conjunction with the 3DEP DEMs, and WBD to create a hydro-enforced DEM, for generation of the catchment Grid/shapefile, and
					flow direction/accumulation Grids. The enhanced NHD was used to compute and assign flowline Value Added Attributes (VAAs) to this
					network. </srccontr>

        <srccontr>12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC 12) divides from the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) were used as ridgeline enforcment input
					in a process called "walling" in the production of hydro-enforced DEMs. Closed basin designations, from the HUC 12 polygon data
					were used to impose "sinks" in the hydro-enforced DEMs. These DEMs are the source data from which NHDPlus HR Catchments are
					delineated from. Catchments with corresponding boundaries in the WBD generally agree with the WBD to within one or two 10-m grid
					cells. Some larger differences between catchment boundaries and WBD boundaries do exist, however. NHDPlus HR Flow Direction and
					Accumulation Grids are hydrologic derivative products of the hydro-enforced DEMs. Dates of WBD snapshots used were as follows:
					August 31, 2010 - VPU 04 March 10, 2011 - VPUs 05, 06 July 14, 2011 - VPU 17 September 16, 2011 - VPU 10L October 7, 2011 - VPU
					10U November 14, 2011 - VPUs 07, 11 December 2, 2011- VPU 18 December 21, 2011 - VPUs 09, 12 February 1, 2012 - VPUs 01, 02, 03N,
					03S, 03W, 08, 13, 14, 15, 16 October 2014 - VPUs 20, 21 April 2015 - VPUs 22AS, 22GU, 22MP The February 1, 2012 WBD snapshot used
					to migrate NHD medium resolution Reachcode assignment to agree with WBD HUC 8 codes. Reachcodes in VPUs 20, 21, 22AS, 22GU, and
					22MP agree with their WBDSnapshots. </srccontr>
