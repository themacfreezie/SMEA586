  <abstract>Purpose and Availability of the Anadromous Waters Catalog and AtlasAlaska Statute 16.05.871(a) requires the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) to specify the various rivers, lakes, and streams, or parts of them, that are important for spawning, rearing, or migration of anadromous fishes. Adopted by reference under 5 AAC 95.011 of the Alaska Administrative Code, the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes (referred to as the "Catalog") and the Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes (referred to as the "Atlas") are used to make this specification. The Catalog is a numerically-ordered list of the water bodies with documented use by anadromous fish for these purposes. The Atlas shows cartographically the location, name and number of these specified water bodies, the anadromous fish species using these water bodies, and the fish life history phases for which the water bodies are used (to the extent known).Protection of these specified water bodies is addressed by other sections of AS 16.05.871, which requires persons or governmental agencies to submit plans and specifications to ADF&amp;G and receive written approval in the form of a Fish Habitat Permit prior to beginning the proposed use, construction or activity that would take place in specified water bodies.Copies of the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes for a specified region may be obtained by writing to the ADF&amp;G Division of Sport Fish at 333 Raspberry Road, Anchorage, AK 99518-1599 (907-267-2336).Copies of the entire Atlas of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes are available for examination at the ADF&amp;G, Division of Sport Fish or Habitat offices in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Copies are also available for viewing at the Alaska State Library in Juneau and the Alaska Resources Library and Information Services (ARLIS) in Anchorage. Copies of regional volumes of the Atlas for the region of the state in which they are located are available for inspection at ADF&amp;G offices in Craig, Delta Junction, Douglas, Homer, Ketchikan, King Salmon, Nome, Soldotna, and Tok.

The Catalog of Waters Important for the Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes and its associated Atlas (the Catalog and Atlas, respectively) currently lists almost 20,000 streams, rivers or lakes around the state which have been specified as being important for the spawning, rearing or migration of anadromous fish. However, based upon thorough surveys of a few drainages it is believed that this number represents a fraction of the streams, rivers, and lakes actually used by anadromous species. Until these habitats are inventoried, they will not be protected under State of Alaska law.</abstract>
